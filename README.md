# KnotTheory

# Restrictions of Image
 - Can't have different arcs touching eachother

# Ideas
 - Maybe not necessary to do BFS on all pixels of an arc? Just find the boundary?
 - Could do that by BFSing the background, going one pixel in on the found arcs, and those are are the boundary points
 - For links, the knots might be different colors. Add component functionality
## To Connect Endpoints
 - check distance from the endpoints and the intersection (intersection should be relatively equadistant between endpoints)
